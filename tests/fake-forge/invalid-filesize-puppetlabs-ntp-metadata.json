[Setup - The basics of getting started with ntp](#setup)\n4. [Usage - Configuration options and additional functionality](#usage)\n5. [Reference - An under-the-hood peek at what the module is doing and how](#reference)\n5. [Limitations - OS compatibility, etc.](#limitations)\n6. [Development - Guide for contributing to the module](#development)\n\n##Overview\n\nThe ntp module installs, configures, and manages the NTP service.\n\n##Module Description\n\nThe ntp module handles installing, configuring, and running NTP across a range of operating systems and distributions.\n\n##Setup\n\n###Beginning with ntp\n\n`include '::ntp'` is enough to get you up and running.  If you wish to pass in parameters specifying which servers to use, then:\n\n```puppet\nclass { '::ntp':\n  servers => [ 'ntp1.corp.com', 'ntp2.corp.com' ],\n}\n```\n\n##Usage\n\nAll interaction with the ntp module can be done through the main ntp class. This means you can simply toggle the options in `::ntp` to have full functionality of the module.\n\n###I just want NTP, what's the minimum I need?\n\n```puppet\ninclude '::ntp'\n```\n\n###I just want to tweak the servers, nothing else.\n\n```puppet\nclass { '::ntp':\n  servers => [ 'ntp1.corp.com', 'ntp2.corp.com' ],\n}\n```\n\n###I'd like to make sure I restrict who can connect as well.\n\n```puppet\nclass { '::ntp':\n  servers  => [ 'ntp1.corp.com', 'ntp2.corp.com' ],\n  restrict => ['127.0.0.1'],\n}\n```\n\n###I just want to install a client that can't be queried\n\n```puppet\nclass { '::ntp':\n  servers   => ['ntp1.corp.com', 'ntp2.corp.com'],\n  restrict  => [\n    'default ignore',\n    '-6 default ignore',\n    '127.0.0.1',\n    '-6 ::1',\n    'ntp1.corp.com nomodify notrap nopeer noquery',\n    'ntp2.corp.com nomodify notrap nopeer noquery'\n  ],\n}\n```\n\n###I only want to listen on specific interfaces, not on 0.0.0.0\n\nRestricting ntp to a specific interface is especially useful on Openstack nodes which may have numerous virtual interfaces.\n\n```puppet\nclass { '::ntp':\n  servers  => [ 'ntp1.corp.com', 'ntp2.corp.com' ],\n  interfaces => ['127.0.0.1', '1.2.3.4']\n}\n```\n\n###I'd like to opt out of having the service controlled; we use another tool for that.\n\n```puppet\nclass { '::ntp':\n  servers        => [ 'ntp1.corp.com', 'ntp2.corp.com' ],\n  restrict       => ['127.0.0.1'],\n  service_manage => false,\n}\n```\n\n###I'd like to configure and run ntp, but I don't need to install it.\n\n```puppet\nclass { '::ntp':\n  package_manage => false,\n}\n```\n\n###Looks great!  But I'd like a different template; we need to do something unique here.\n\n```puppet\nclass { '::ntp':\n  servers         => [ 'ntp1.corp.com', 'ntp2.corp.com' ],\n  restrict        => ['127.0.0.1'],\n  service_manage  => false,\n  config_epp      => 'different/module/custom.template.epp',\n}\n```\n\n##Reference\n\n###Classes\n\n####Public Classes\n\n* ntp: Main class, includes all other classes.\n\n####Private Classes\n\n* ntp::install: Handles the packages.\n* ntp::config: Handles the configuration file.\n* ntp::service: Handles the service.\n\n###Parameters\n\nThe following parameters are available in the `::ntp` class:\n\n####`broadcastclient`\n\nEnable reception of broadcast server messages to any local interface.\n\n####`config`\n\nSpecifies a file for ntp's configuration info.

Additionally, it is tested (but not supported) on Solaris 10 and Fedora 20-22.\n\n##Development\n\nPuppet Labs modules on the Puppet Forge are open projects, and community contributions are essential for keeping them great. We can’t access the huge number of platforms and myriad of hardware, software, and deployment configurations that Puppet is intended to serve.\n\nWe want to keep it as easy as possible to contribute changes so that our modules work in your environment. There are a few guidelines that we need contributors to follow so that we can have a chance of keeping on top of things.\n\nFor more information, see our [module contribution guide.](https://docs.puppetlabs.com/forge/contributing.html)\n\n###Contributors\n\nTo see who's already involved, see the [list of contributors.](https://github.com/puppetlabs/puppetlabs-ntp/graphs/contributors)\n",
  "changelog": "## Supported Releases 5.0.0 and 6.0.0\n### Summary\n\nThis double release adds new Puppet 4 features: data in modules, EPP templates, the $facts hash, and data types. The 5.0.0 release is fully backwards compatible to existing Puppet 4 configurations and provides you with [deprecation warnings](https://github.com/puppetlabs/puppetlabs-stdlib#deprecation) for every argument that will not work as expected with the final 6.0.0 release. See the [stdlib docs](https://github.com/puppetlabs/puppetlabs-stdlib#validate_legacy) for an in-depth discussion of this.\n\nIf you want to learn more about the new features used, have a look at the [NTP: A Puppet 4 language update](https://puppet.com/blog/ntp-puppet-4-language-update) blog post.\n\nIf you're still running Puppet 3, remain on the latest puppetlabs-ntp 4.x release for now, and see the documentation to [upgrade to Puppet 4](https://docs.puppet.com/puppet/4.6/reference/upgrade_major_pre.html).\n\n### Changes\n\n* [Data in modules](https://docs.puppet.com/puppet/latest/reference/lookup_quick_module.html#example-with-hiera): Moves all distribution and OS-dependent defaults into YAML files in `data/`, alleviating the need for a `params` class. Note that while this feature is currently still classed as experimental, the final implementation will support the changes here.\n* [EPP templating](https://docs.puppet.com/puppet/latest/reference/lang_template_epp.html): Uses the Puppet language as a base for templates to create simpler and safer templates. No need for Ruby anymore! You can pass in EPP templates for the `ntp.conf` and `step-tickers` files using the new `config_epp` and `step_tickers_epp` parameters.\n* [The $facts hash](https://docs.puppet.com/puppet/latest/reference/lang_facts_and_builtin_vars.html#the-factsfactname-hash): Makes facts visibly distinct from other variables for more readable and maintainable code. This helps eliminate confusion if you use a local variable whose name happens to match that of a common fact.\n* [Data types for validation](https://docs.puppet.com/puppet/4.6/reference/lang_data.html): Helps you find and replace deprecated code in existing `validate_*` functions with stricter, more readable data type notation. First upgrade to the 5.0.0 release of this module, and address all deprecation warnings before upgrading to the final 6.0.0 release. Please see the [stdlib docs](https://github.com/puppetlabs/puppetlabs-stdlib#validate_legacy) for an in-depth discussion of this process.\n\n## Supported Release 4.2.0\n### Summary\n\nA large release with many new features.
